Here you will find instruction for the challenges

The two UR5 will be at 80cm distance one to each other, parallel to the mockup orchard.
One fixed base camera will be placed between the two arms, centered, and placed backwards at about 30cm with respect to the center of the two arm bases.
The mockup orchard will be placed at about 60cm distance from the arms baseline.
A wrist camera will be placed attached to the wrist interface, 3cm backwards and 6cm above the hand (palm up).
The apples will hang from the orchard plane with some distance from the background orchard plane surface.

NOTE: The ROS UR5 controller is intended to control one arm. To have both arms running simultaneously, the UR5 nodes needs to be replicated and eventually separated using different namespaces.
