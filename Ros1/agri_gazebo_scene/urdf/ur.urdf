    Main xacro macro definition of the "Gazebo robot" model.

    This wraps the model of the real robot and adds all elements and parameters
    required by Gazebo.

    It also adds the gazebo_ros_control plugin.

    NOTE: this is NOT a URDF. It cannot directly be loaded by consumers
    expecting a flattened '.urdf' file. See the top-level '.xacro' for that
    (but note: that .xacro must still be processed by the xacro command).

    For use in '.launch' files: use one of the 'load_urX.launch' convenience
    launch files.

    NOTE: this Gazebo model makes use of the same set of parameter files as the
    main xacro macro (in ur_description). It is therefor possible to use the
    kinematic calibration exported from a REAL UR robot. Please refer to the
    ur_macro.xacro in ur_description for more information about this.

    Main author of the migration to yaml configs: Ludovic Delval.
